// Your next task is to create a users.test.js file within the users folder. Then within 
// the users.test.js file, write a bare bones test (the test name can be "GET /api/health works" 
//     and the test callback can be left empty). Whilst this 
// isn't a useful test yet, it's enough to register the test. Then run Vitest to check it detects the test file and the test passes.
